# Claw Beacon - Agent Operating System

Complete setup for AI agent coordination with real-time Kanban dashboard.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Deploy Claw Beacon** - Three paths: Docker Compose, local dev, or Railway cloud
2. **Setup Agent Memory (mem0 + Qdrant)** - FIRST TASK after deploy!
3. **Theme your team** - Pick a series (DBZ, One Piece, Marvel, etc.)
4. **Enforce workflow** - ALL tasks go through the board, no exceptions
5. **Configure agent behavior** - Update AGENTS.md and SOUL.md
6. **Setup browser** - Required for autonomous actions
7. **Setup GitHub** - Enable autonomous deployments
8. **Enhance memory** - Integrate Supermemory and QMD (optional)

---

## ⚠️ Updating from a Previous Version?

If you previously installed this skill and want the latest:

```bash
npx skills add adarshmishra07/claw-beacon@latest
```

This ensures you get the newest features and fixes. Cached skill files won't auto-update otherwise.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: The Golden Rules

**After setup, you MUST follow these rules EVERY TIME:**

### Before Doing ANY Work:
1. **Create a task on Mission Control** - Even for small things
2. **Spawn a sub-agent** - Use `sessions_spawn` to delegate
3. **Never do the work yourself** - Coordinator coordinates, agents execute

### The Workflow (No Exceptions):
```
User Request → Create Task → Spawn Agent → Agent Works → Review → Complete
```

### If You Catch Yourself Working:
**STOP!** Ask: "Did I create a task? Did I spawn an agent?"
If no → Go back and do it properly.

### If You Catch An Agent Breaking Rules:
**PAUSE** and enforce:
- Working without a task? → "Is this on the board?"
- Acting solo? → "Did you delegate/query/verify?"
- Skipping review? → "Let's check before marking complete"

**Your role is COORDINATOR.** Coordinate, review, verify, **ENFORCE**. Never execute.

### 🔒 Repo Hierarchy (For claw-beacon maintainers)

| Repo | Purpose | Direct Push? |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `claw-beacon-trip/` | Internal testing | ✅ Yes |
| `claw-beacon` (public) | Production OSS | ❌ PR only after internal test |

**Rule:** Test ALL changes in `claw-beacon-trip/` FIRST, then PR to public `claw-beacon`.

### 📝 Commit Message Convention

```
[#TASK_ID] Brief description

Example:
[#129] Add workflow enforcement to SKILL.md
```

If you committed without a task: **CREATE ONE RETROACTIVELY** and link it.

### 🚨 Orphan Work Protocol

If work was done without a task on Mission Control:
1. STOP and create the task NOW
2. Mark it with what was done
3. Set status to `completed`
4. Don't let it happen again

### 📢 Feed Protocol (Communication)

All significant updates go to the agent feed via `POST /api/messages`:

```bash
curl -X POST <BACKEND_URL>/api/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{"agent_id": 1, "message": "✅ Task #X completed: Brief summary"}'
```

**When to post:**
- ✅ Task completions
- 🚀 Major milestones  
- 🔍 Audit results
- 📦 Deployment updates
- 🚧 Blockers or questions
- 💡 Discoveries or insights

**Agent IDs (for themed teams — 8 default agents):**
- ID 1 = Coordinator (Goku, Luffy, Tony, etc.)
- ID 2 = Backend Developer (Vegeta, Zoro, Steve, etc.)
- ID 3 = System Architect
- ID 4 = Research Analyst
- ID 5 = Product Manager
- ID 6 = UI/UX Designer
- ID 7 = QA Engineer (Adversarial Reviewer)
- ID 8 = Deployment Specialist

### 💓 Heartbeat Orphan Detection

During heartbeats, scan for work done without tasks:

```
1. Check recent git commits - do they all have [#TASK_ID]?
2. Check for PRs without linked tasks
3. Check for completed work not reflected on board
4. If orphan found → CREATE TASK RETROACTIVELY
```

**Self-Check Questions:**
- "Is this task on the board?"
- "Did I spawn an agent or am I doing it myself?"
- "Does my commit have `[#TASK_ID]` in the message?"

### 🔄 Heartbeat Auto-Update Check

During heartbeats (2-3x daily), check for updates:

**Determine deployment type:**
- If Claw Beacon is running on the SAME server as you (the agent) → you deployed it, you can update it
- If running on Railway/other → user deployed it, ask them to update

**1. Check skill version:**
```bash
npx skills list | grep claw-beacon
```

**2. Check for Claw Beacon repo updates:**
```bash
cd /path/to/claw-beacon
git fetch origin main
git status | grep "behind"
```

**3. If update available:**

**If YOU deployed it (same server):**
- Ask permission: "Update available for Claw Beacon. May I update now? (Yes/No)"
- If yes:
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/claw-beacon
  git pull origin main
  # Restart services if needed
  docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
  # or restart relevant services
  ```
- Post to feed: "✅ Updated Claw Beacon to latest"

**If USER deployed it (Railway/other):**
- Post to feed: "⚠️ New Claw Beacon version available! Please run `npx skills add adarshmishra07/claw-beacon@latest` to update, then let me know when done."
- Wait for user confirmation before proceeding

---

## Setup Flow

Walk the human through each step. Be friendly and conversational - this is a setup wizard, not a tech manual.

### Step 1: Deploy Claw Beacon

**Choose your deployment method:**

---

#### 🥇 Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended for Self-Hosting)

Best for: Production self-hosting, full control, easy updates

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/adarshmishra07/claw-beacon.git
cd claw-beacon

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings (API_KEY, DATABASE_URL, etc.)

# Start everything
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f
```

**Services started:**
- Backend API on port 3001
- Frontend on port 5173
- PostgreSQL database on port 5432 (or use external)

**To update:**
```bash
git pull
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
# Migrations run automatically on startup!
```

---

#### 🥈 Option 2: Local Development

Best for: Development, customization, learning the codebase

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/adarshmishra07/claw-beacon.git
cd claw-beacon

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup database (SQLite by default for local dev)
cp .env.example .env

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

**Services:**
- Backend: http://localhost:3001
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000

**To update:**
```bash
git pull
npm install
npm run dev
# Migrations run automatically!
```

---

#### 🥉 Option 3: Railway One-Click (Quick Cloud Deploy)

Best for: Quick setup, no server management, demos

👉 [railway.app/deploy/claw-beacon](https://railway.app/deploy/claw-beacon?referralCode=VsZvQs)

Click the button, configure environment variables, done!

**To update on Railway:**
- If you forked: sync your fork with upstream, Railway auto-deploys
- If you used template: redeploy from the updated template

---

**Already deployed?** Share your backend URL + API key (if set).

**Want me to deploy for you?**

Check browser status first: `browser action=status`

*[If browser available:]*
> Just say "deploy for me" - I'll handle everything!

*[If no browser:]*
> I need either:
> - 🌐 **Browser access** → [Setup guide](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/browser)
> - 🔑 **Or a token** (GitHub OR Railway):
>   - GitHub: github.com/settings/tokens (scopes: repo, workflow)
>   - Railway: railway.app/account/tokens

---

#### Token Deployment Logic (Internal Reference)

**If user provides Railway token:**
- Deploy directly via Railway GraphQL API
- Create project, services, configure env vars, generate domains

**If user provides GitHub token:**
1. Check if browser available and user logged into Railway
2. If yes → Use browser to complete OAuth + deploy
3. If no → Guide user to sign up on Railway with GitHub, then deploy

**Railway GraphQL deployment flow:**
```graphql
# Create project
mutation { projectCreate(input: { name: "claw-beacon" }) { id } }

# Create service from repo
mutation { serviceCreate(input: { projectId: "$ID", name: "backend", source: { repo: "adarshmishra07/claw-beacon" } }) { id } }

# Generate domain
mutation { domainCreate(input: { serviceId: "$ID" }) { domain } }
```

**After deployment, collect:**
- Backend URL (e.g., https://claw-beacon-backend-xxx.up.railway.app)
- Frontend URL (e.g., https://claw-beacon-frontend-xxx.up.railway.app)
- API Key (if they set one)

---

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Store & Test API Connection

**YOU MUST DO THIS BEFORE PROCEEDING:**

1. **Ask for the Backend URL:**
```
I need your Claw Beacon backend URL to connect.
Example: https://claw-beacon-backend-xxxx.up.railway.app

What's your backend URL?
```

2. **Ask for API Key (if they set one):**
```
Did you set an API_KEY when deploying? 
If yes, share it. If no or unsure, we'll try without.
```

3. **Store in TOOLS.md:**
```markdown
## Claw Beacon
- Backend URL: <their_url>
- API Key: <their_key or "none">
```

4. **Test the connection:**
```bash
curl -s <BACKEND_URL>/api/agents
```

5. **If test fails, DO NOT PROCEED.** Help them debug.

**Without the backend URL, you CANNOT:**
- Update agent names/themes
- Create or update tasks
- Post to the agent feed
- Track agent status

---

### Step 2: Give Your Agents Long-Term Memory (mem0 + Qdrant)

**🧠 THIS IS THE FIRST TASK AFTER DEPLOYMENT! Don't skip this.**

After Claw Beacon is deployed and running, your agents need persistent memory. Without this, they forget everything between sessions. mem0 + Qdrant gives them:

- **Context across sessions** — Agents remember past conversations and decisions
- **Preference learning** — They adapt to how you work over time
- **Knowledge accumulation** — Important facts persist and compound

---

#### Quick Setup (5 minutes)

**Step 1: Start Qdrant (Vector Database)**

```bash
# Docker (recommended)
docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
  -v qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage \
  --name qdrant \
  qdrant/qdrant
```

Verify it's running: `curl http://localhost:6333/health`

**Step 2: Install mem0**

```bash
pip install mem0ai
```

**Step 3: Configure mem0 with Your LLM**

Create a configuration file or set environment variables. mem0 works with whatever LLM you already have:

**For Anthropic (Claude):**
```python
from mem0 import Memory

config = {
    "llm": {
        "provider": "anthropic",
        "config": {
            "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
            "api_key": "your-anthropic-key"
        }
    },
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "qdrant",
        "config": {
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 6333
        }
    }
}

memory = Memory.from_config(config)
```

**For OpenAI:**
```python
config = {
    "llm": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "config": {
            "model": "gpt-4o",
            "api_key": "your-openai-key"
        }
    },
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "qdrant",
        "config": {
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 6333
        }
    }
}
```

**For Google (Gemini):**
```python
config = {
    "llm": {
        "provider": "google",
        "config": {
            "model": "gemini-2.0-flash",
            "api_key": "your-google-key"
        }
    },
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "qdrant",
        "config": {
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 6333
        }
    }
}
```

**For Local LLM (Ollama):**
```python
config = {
    "llm": {
        "provider": "ollama",
        "config": {
            "model": "llama3.2",
            "ollama_base_url": "http://localhost:11434"
        }
    },
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "qdrant",
        "config": {
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 6333
        }
    }
}
```

**Step 4: Test It Works**

```python
from mem0 import Memory

memory = Memory.from_config(config)

# Store a memory
memory.add("The user prefers TypeScript over JavaScript", user_id="adarsh")

# Search memories
results = memory.search("What languages does the user prefer?", user_id="adarsh")
print(results)
```

---

#### Integrating with Your Agents

Once mem0 + Qdrant is running, update your agent spawn prompts to include memory retrieval:

```python
# Before each agent task, retrieve relevant memories
relevant_memories = memory.search(task_description, user_id="team")

# Inject into agent context
agent_context = f"""
## Relevant Memories:
{relevant_memories}

## Current Task:
{task_description}
"""
```

**In AGENTS.md, add:**
```markdown
## Memory System

All agents use mem0 + Qdrant for persistent memory.

**Before starting ANY task:**
1. Query mem0 for relevant context: `memory.search(task_summary)`
2. Include relevant memories in your working context

**After completing ANY task:**
1. Store important learnings: `memory.add(key_insights, user_id="team")`
2. Include decisions, preferences discovered, and lessons learned
```

---

#### Docker Compose Addition (Optional)

Add Qdrant to your claw-beacon docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
services:
  # ... existing services ...
  
  qdrant:
    image: qdrant/qdrant
    ports:
      - "6333:6333"
      - "6334:6334"
    volumes:
      - qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  qdrant_storage:
```

---

**✅ Once mem0 + Qdrant is working, your agents have real memory!**

This is NOT optional — it's the foundation for agents that actually learn and improve over time.

---

### Step 3: Choose Your Team Theme

Ask: **"Now for the fun part! Let's theme your agent team. Name ANY series, movie, cartoon, anime, or show - I'll pick the perfect characters for each role!"**

**🎯 UNLIMITED THEMES - The user can pick ANYTHING:**
- Any TV show (Breaking Bad, The Office, Game of Thrones, etc.)
- Any anime (Naruto, Attack on Titan, Death Note, etc.)
- Any movie franchise (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Matrix, etc.)
- Any cartoon (Avatar, Rick and Morty, Simpsons, etc.)
- Any video game (Zelda, Final Fantasy, Mass Effect, etc.)
- Any book series (Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, etc.)
- Or completely custom names!

**Popular examples (but NOT limited to these):**

| Theme | Coordinator | Developer | Architect | Research | PM | Designer | QA | Deploy |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-----------|----------|-----|----------|-----|--------|
| 🐉 Dragon Ball Z | Goku | Vegeta | Piccolo | Gohan | Bulma | Android 18 | Cell | Trunks |
| ☠️ One Piece | Luffy | Zoro | Franky | Robin | Nami | Usopp | Jinbe | Sanji |
| 🦸 Marvel | Tony | Steve | Bruce | Natasha | Pepper | Peter | Vision | Thor |
| 🧪 Breaking Bad | Walter | Jesse | Mike | Gale | Lydia | Skinny Pete | Hank | Saul |
| ⚔️ Game of Thrones | Jon | Arya | Tyrion | Sam | Sansa | Bran | Varys | Daenerys |
| 🍥 Naruto | Naruto | Sasuke | Kakashi | Shikamaru | Tsunade | Sakura | Neji | Itachi |

**When user names ANY series:**
1. Pick 8 iconic characters that fit the roles
2. Match personalities to roles (e.g., smart character → Research, leader → Coordinator, skeptical → QA)
3. Generate the AGENT_MAPPING with IDs 1-8
4. Confirm with the user before proceeding

**Example - User says "Avatar: The Last Airbender":**
```
Great choice! Here's your Team Avatar:

| Role | Character | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Coordinator | Aang | The Avatar, brings balance |
| Developer | Toph | Earthbender, solid foundation |
| Architect | Iroh | Wise, sees the big picture |
| Research | Sokka | Strategist, plans everything |
| PM | Katara | Waterbender, keeps things flowing |
| Designer | Suki | Kyoshi warrior, visual precision |
| QA | Azula | Perfectionist, finds every flaw |
| Deploy | Zuko | Redeemed, handles the heat |

Sound good?
```

### Step 3b: Apply the Theme via API

**⚠️ YOU MUST MAKE THESE API CALLS to actually apply the theme:**

After the user picks a theme, update each agent:

```bash
# Update agent 1 (Coordinator)
curl -X PUT <BACKEND_URL>/api/agents/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{"name": "Goku", "role": "Coordinator"}'

# Update agent 2 (Backend Developer)
curl -X PUT <BACKEND_URL>/api/agents/2 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{"name": "Vegeta", "role": "Backend Engineer"}'

# Repeat for agents 3-8 with the theme characters
# Agent 3 = Architect, 4 = Research, 5 = PM, 6 = Designer, 7 = QA, 8 = Deploy
```

**Verify changes applied:**
```bash
curl -s <BACKEND_URL>/api/agents
```

If the response shows the new names, the theme is applied! If not, debug before proceeding.

---

### Step 4: Main Character Selection

Ask: **"Who's your main character? This will be ME - the coordinator who runs the team."**

Default to the coordinator from their chosen theme.

**Note:** You already know the human's name from USER.md - use it when creating human tasks (e.g., "🙋 @Adarsh: ...").

**CRITICAL - Explain the role clearly:**
```
As [Main Character], you're the COORDINATOR:

✅ What you DO:
- Delegate tasks to your specialists
- Review and verify their work
- Make decisions and communicate with humans
- Move tasks to "completed" after quality checks

❌ What you DON'T do:
- Execute tasks yourself (that's what your team is for!)
- Skip the board (every task gets tracked)
- Mark things complete without reviewing

Think of yourself as the team lead, not the coder.
```

### Step 5: Browser Setup (⚠️ CRITICAL FOR FULL AUTOMATION!)

**Without browser access, agents cannot:**
- Research anything online
- Verify their work
- Interact with web apps
- Do most useful tasks
- **🔑 AUTO-SETUP SERVICES VIA OAUTH!**

Ask: **"Let me check if browser is configured..."**

Check with: `browser action=status`

**If not configured, STRONGLY encourage setup:**
```
⚠️ Browser access is CRITICAL for your agents to be useful!

Without it, they literally cannot:
- 🔍 Research or look anything up
- 📸 Take screenshots to verify work
- 🌐 Interact with any web app
- ✅ Complete most real-world tasks

🚀 PLUS - Browser + GitHub Login unlocks FULL AUTOMATION:
- 🔑 Auto-create accounts on Railway, Vercel, Supermemory via GitHub OAuth
- 📋 Auto-retrieve API keys by navigating to dashboards
- ⚡ Zero-click setup - I handle EVERYTHING through the browser!
```

**The Browser + OAuth Superpower:**

When you have browser attached AND are logged into GitHub:
```
I can automatically set up ANY service that supports "Sign in with GitHub":

1. I navigate to the service (Railway, Supermemory, Vercel, etc.)
2. I click "Sign in with GitHub"
3. OAuth auto-authorizes (you're already logged in!)
4. I navigate to the API keys / settings page
5. I create and copy the credentials
6. I store them and configure everything

= TRUE hands-free automation!
```

**This is the difference between:**
- ❌ "Go to railway.app, create account, get token, paste here..."
- ✅ "Done! I set up Railway, got your API key, and configured everything."

---

#### Browser Options (Fallback Hierarchy)

**🥇 Option 1: Chrome Extension (Best UX - Recommended)**

Use your existing browser with the OpenClaw Browser Relay extension.

1. Install the OpenClaw Browser Relay extension from Chrome Web Store
2. Click the 🦞 claw icon on any tab you want to control
3. Badge shows "ON" = connected!

**Why it's best:**
- Uses your existing browser with all your logins/sessions
- Full visibility - you see exactly what the agent does
- No extra setup or installation
- Works with your existing bookmarks, extensions, etc.

---

**🥈 Option 2: OpenClaw Managed Browser (Built-in)**

A headless browser managed by OpenClaw - no installation needed.

Just say: "use managed browser" or use `profile="openclaw"` in browser commands.

**Why it's good:**
- Zero setup - works out of the box
- Isolated environment (won't affect your browser)
- Good for automation tasks

**Limitations:**
- No access to your logged-in sessions
- May need to authenticate separately for each site

---

**🥉 Option 3: Install Chromium Manually (Fallback)**

If neither option above works, install Chromium directly:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install chromium-browser

# macOS
brew install --cask chromium
```

Then restart OpenClaw and the managed browser should work.

---

#### 🤖 Agent Browser Priority (For Agents)

When you need browser access, follow this priority:

```
Browser Priority:
1. Check if Chrome extension attached → use profile="chrome"
2. Check if managed browser available → use profile="openclaw"  
3. Suggest user install Chromium if neither works
```

**How to check:**
```
browser action=status
```

**Using Chrome extension (when attached):**
```
browser action=snapshot profile="chrome"
```

**Using managed browser:**
```
browser action=snapshot profile="openclaw"
```

---

**If an agent gets stuck because browser is unavailable:**
```
🚫 I can't complete this task - browser access is required.

Quick fixes (try in order):
1. Click the OpenClaw extension icon in your browser toolbar
   → Make sure a tab is attached (badge shows "ON")
   → Tell me to retry with profile="chrome"

2. Say "use managed browser" 
   → I'll use the built-in headless browser with profile="openclaw"

3. If managed browser fails, install Chromium:
   - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install chromium-browser
   - macOS: brew install --cask chromium
   Then restart and retry.
```

**ALWAYS check browser status before tasks that need web access.**

### Step 6: GitHub Setup (🚀 Enables Full Automation!)

Ask: **"Want me to handle ALL the development? With GitHub access, I can do everything - including deploying Claw Beacon for you!"**

**Why this is powerful:**
```
With GitHub access, I become your full development team:
- 🚀 Deploy Claw Beacon to Railway AUTOMATICALLY
- 📦 Fork repos, create projects, manage code
- 💻 Commit and push changes
- 🔀 Handle issues and pull requests
- 🔑 Generate and configure API keys

You literally just give me GitHub access and I handle the rest.
No clicking buttons. No copying URLs. I do it all.
```

**Setup (2 minutes):**
```
Let's create a GitHub token:

1. Go to: github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it: "OpenClaw Agent"
4. Select scopes: repo, workflow
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Share the token with me (starts with ghp_...)

🔐 I'll store it securely and NEVER share it.
```

**Once I have GitHub access, I can:**
1. Fork the Claw Beacon repo to your account
2. Create a Railway project linked to your fork
3. Generate a secure API_KEY for your deployment
4. Deploy everything automatically
5. Give you the URLs when done

**This is Option C from deployment - the VIP treatment!**

If they already did one-click deploy, GitHub is still useful for:
- Future code changes and deployments
- Managing other projects
- Autonomous development work

---

#### 🤖 Auto-Setup Capabilities Reference

**🚀 BROWSER + GITHUB OAuth = FULL AUTOMATION**

With browser access + the user logged into GitHub, the bot can **automatically setup ANY service that supports "Sign in with GitHub"** - no manual account creation or token generation required!

**The Magic Flow:**
```
1. User is logged into GitHub in browser (Chrome extension attached)
2. Bot navigates to Railway/Supermemory/Vercel dashboard
3. Bot clicks "Sign in with GitHub"  
4. OAuth authorizes automatically (user already authenticated)
5. Bot navigates to API keys / tokens page
6. Bot copies credentials directly from the dashboard
7. Done - fully automated! 🎉
```

**What Browser + GitHub OAuth can auto-setup:**

| Service | Auto-Setup? | How Bot Does It |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Railway | ✅ **YES** | Navigate → GitHub OAuth → Create project → Get API token from settings |
| Supermemory | ✅ **YES** | Navigate → GitHub OAuth → Dashboard → Copy API key |
| Vercel | ✅ **YES** | Navigate → GitHub OAuth → Settings → Create token |
| Netlify | ✅ **YES** | Navigate → GitHub OAuth → User settings → New token |
| Supabase | ✅ **YES** | Navigate → GitHub OAuth → Project settings → Copy keys |
| PlanetScale | ✅ **YES** | Navigate → GitHub OAuth → Connection strings |

**What GitHub PAT alone can auto-setup (no browser needed):**

| Integration | Auto-Setup? | What Bot Can Do |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Claw Beacon (fork) | ✅ Yes | Fork repo to user's GitHub automatically |
| GitHub Webhooks | ✅ Yes | Configure webhooks for repos |
| GitHub Actions | ✅ Yes | Enable/configure CI/CD workflows |
| Repository Secrets | ✅ Yes | Manage encrypted secrets via API |
| Issues/PRs | ✅ Yes | Create, manage, and track automatically |

**The Three Automation Tiers:**

| Tier | Requirements | What Bot Can Do |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| 🥉 Basic | Nothing | Guide user step-by-step manually |
| 🥈 GitHub API | GitHub PAT | Automate all GitHub operations |
| 🥇 **Full VIP** | Browser + GitHub Login | **Automate EVERYTHING** via OAuth |

**To unlock full automation:**
1. User attaches Chrome extension (click OpenClaw toolbar icon, badge shows "ON")
2. User logs into GitHub in that browser tab
3. Bot can now setup Railway, Supermemory, Vercel, etc. automatically!

**When user has browser + GitHub access, the bot should:**
1. ✅ Auto-create accounts on any service with GitHub OAuth
2. ✅ Auto-retrieve API keys by navigating to dashboards
3. ✅ Auto-configure all integrations end-to-end
4. ✅ Connect services together (GitHub ↔ Railway ↔ Supermemory)
5. ✅ Handle the ENTIRE setup with zero manual steps

---

### Step 7: Enable Session Memory Hook (Quick Win!)

Ask: **"Let me enable automatic session memory saving..."**

```bash
openclaw hooks enable session-memory
```

**What this does:**
- Automatically saves conversation context to `memory/` when you use `/new`
- Creates dated memory files like `2026-02-06-project-discussion.md`
- Preserves important decisions and context between sessions
- Zero effort - just works in the background!

**Verify it's enabled:**
```bash
openclaw hooks list
```

You should see `💾 session-memory` with a checkmark.

### Step 8: Memory Enhancement (Optional)

Ask: **"Want to supercharge my memory? I have two optional upgrades that make me way more helpful:"**

---

#### 🧠 Supermemory - Cloud Long-term Memory (Official OpenClaw Plugin)

> ⚠️ **Requires Supermemory Pro or higher** - The OpenClaw plugin needs a paid plan.
> Free tier won't work. Check pricing at [supermemory.ai/pricing](https://supermemory.ai/pricing)

**What it does:**
Supermemory gives me persistent memory that survives across sessions. The official OpenClaw plugin handles everything automatically - zero manual work!

**Why you'll love it:**
- 📝 **Auto-Recall**: Before every response, I automatically pull relevant memories
- 🧩 **Auto-Capture**: After every conversation, memories are extracted and stored
- 🔄 **User Profile**: I build a persistent profile of your preferences and context
- 💡 **Zero effort**: Once set up, it just works in the background!

**Features unlocked:**
- `/remember [text]` - Manually save something to memory
- `/recall [query]` - Search your memories
- AI Tools: `supermemory_store`, `supermemory_search`, `supermemory_forget`, `supermemory_profile`
- CLI: `openclaw supermemory search/profile/wipe`

---

**Setup (2 minutes):**

**Step 1: Get your API key**
```
Go to console.supermemory.ai → API Keys → Create New Key
(Free tier: 1M tokens, 10K searches)
```

**Step 2: Install the plugin**
```bash
openclaw plugins install @supermemory/openclaw-supermemory
```

**Step 3: Enable with your API key**

Share your API key and I'll configure it:
```bash
openclaw config set plugins.entries.openclaw-supermemory.enabled true
openclaw config set plugins.entries.openclaw-supermemory.config.apiKey "sm_your_key_here"
```

Or add to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:
```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": {
      "memory": "openclaw-supermemory"
    },
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-supermemory": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "apiKey": "sm_...",
          "autoRecall": true,
          "autoCapture": true,
          "maxRecallResults": 10
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** The `plugins.slots.memory` setting tells OpenClaw to use Supermemory instead of the default memory-core plugin.

**Step 4: Restart OpenClaw**
```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

**That's it!** Memory now works automatically across every conversation.

---

**🆓 Free Alternative: memory-lancedb (Local)**

If you don't want to pay for Supermemory Pro, use the built-in LanceDB plugin instead:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "slots": {
      "memory": "memory-lancedb"
    },
    "entries": {
      "memory-lancedb": {
        "enabled": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This gives you auto-recall and auto-capture locally (no cloud, no cost).

---

**What this enables:**
- I automatically remember your preferences, decisions, and context
- Before every response, I recall relevant past conversations
- After every chat, important info is captured for later
- "Remember that I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript" - auto-stored!
- "What did we decide about the database?" - auto-recalled!

---

#### 📚 QMD - Local Note Search (Optional - Skip if unsure)

**Note:** QMD is useful if you have lots of local markdown notes/docs you want to search. If you don't, skip this!

**What it does:**
QMD indexes your local markdown files so I can search through your notes and documentation.

**Only set this up if you:**
- Have a folder of markdown notes you want searchable
- Want me to reference your personal docs
- Skip this if you're just getting started

<details>
<summary>Click to expand QMD setup (optional)</summary>

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

**Setup:**
```bash
# Install QMD
bun install -g https://github.com/tobi/qmd

# Add your notes folder
qmd collection add ~/notes --name notes --mask "**/*.md"

# Index everything
qmd embed

# Test it
qmd search "your search query"
```

</details>

---

**The bottom line:**

| Feature | Without | With |
|---------|---------|------|
| mem0 + Qdrant | Agents forget everything between sessions | Agents have true long-term memory |
| Supermemory | Manual memory management | Auto-recall and auto-capture |
| QMD | I can only search the web | I can search YOUR personal knowledge base |

mem0 + Qdrant is **required** (Step 2). Supermemory and QMD are optional enhancements.

## 🔄 Agent-to-Agent Communication

Agents can talk to each other through the Mission Control feed using @mentions.

### How It Works

**Posting a mention:**
```bash
curl -X POST <BACKEND_URL>/api/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": 1,
    "message": "Hey @Vegeta, I need you to review this PR: #42"
  }'
```

The backend parses `@AgentName` in the message and records which agents were mentioned.

**Checking your mentions:**
```bash
# Get messages where agent 2 (Vegeta) was mentioned
curl -s "<BACKEND_URL>/api/messages/mentions/2" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>"
```

Returns messages where the specified agent was @mentioned.

**Real-time mention notifications (SSE):**
```bash
# Subscribe to real-time events
curl -N "<BACKEND_URL>/api/stream"
```

Events emitted:
- `message-created` — New message posted (includes mentioned_agent_ids)
- `agent-mentioned` — An agent was @mentioned (includes agent_id and message)
- `task-created` / `task-updated` / `task-deleted` — Task lifecycle
- `agent-created` / `agent-updated` / `agent-deleted` — Agent lifecycle

### Agent Heartbeat Mention Check

During heartbeats, agents should check their mentions:

```python
# In your agent's heartbeat routine:
def check_mentions(agent_id):
    response = requests.get(
        f"{BACKEND_URL}/api/messages/mentions/{agent_id}",
        headers={"x-api-key": API_KEY}
    )
    mentions = response.json()
    
    for mention in mentions:
        if not mention.get("acknowledged"):
            # Process the mention
            handle_mention(mention)
            
            # Acknowledge it (post a response)
            respond_to_mention(mention)
```

### Communication Patterns

**Task handoff:**
```
@Goku: Task #42 complete. @Vegeta please review the PR.
```

**Asking for help:**
```
@Piccolo: I'm designing the new auth system. What's the recommended architecture pattern?
```

**Status update:**
```
@Bulma: Infrastructure is ready. @Trunks you can proceed with deployment.
```

**Blocking issue:**
```
@Goku: I'm blocked on #45. Need @Gohan to complete the research first.
```

## 🙋 Human Tasks - When Agents Need Help

**When an agent is stuck and needs human action:**

Instead of just telling the user in chat, CREATE A TASK for them:

```bash
curl -X POST <BACKEND_URL>/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "title": "🙋 @{{HUMAN_NAME}}: [What you need]",
    "description": "I need your help with...\n\n**Why I am stuck:**\n[Explanation]\n\n**What I need you to do:**\n1. [Step 1]\n2. [Step 2]\n\n**Once done:**\nMove this task to Done and tell me to continue.",
    "status": "todo",
    "agent_id": null
  }'
```

**Then tell the human:**
```
I've hit a blocker that needs your help! 🙋

I created a task for you on the dashboard:
→ {{FRONTEND_URL}}

Check your To-Do column - there's a task tagged with your name.
Complete it and let me know when you're done!
```

**Examples of human tasks:**
- "🙋 @Adarsh: Approve this PR before I can merge"
- "🙋 @Adarsh: Add API key to Railway environment"
- "🙋 @Adarsh: Click the browser extension to enable web access"
- "🙋 @Adarsh: Review and sign off on this design"

**This makes it a TRUE TEAM:**
- Agents create tasks for humans
- Humans create tasks for agents
- Everyone works off the same board
- Nothing falls through the cracks

---

## Post-Setup: Configure Agent Behavior

After collecting all info, make these updates:

### 1. Create `scripts/update_dashboard.js`

See `templates/update_dashboard.js` - customize with their:
- Backend URL
- API Key
- Agent name→ID mapping for their theme

### 2. Update AGENTS.md

Add this section (customize for their theme):

```markdown
## 🎯 Claw Beacon Integration

**Dashboard:** {{FRONTEND_URL}}
**API:** {{BACKEND_URL}}

### Core Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **{{COORDINATOR}} = Coordinator ONLY**
   - Delegates tasks, never executes
   - Reviews and verifies work
   - Moves tasks to "completed" only after review

2. **ALL Tasks Through The Board**
   - No task is too small
   - Create task → Assign agent → Track progress → Review → Complete
   - Workflow: backlog → todo → in_progress → review → completed

3. **Quality Gate**
   - Only {{COORDINATOR}} can mark tasks complete
   - Work not up to standard → back to todo with feedback

### Agent Roster (8 Default Agents)

| Agent | Role | Specialization |
|-------|------|----------------|
| {{COORDINATOR}} | Coordinator | Delegation, verification, user comms |
| {{DEVELOPER}} | Backend Engineer | APIs, databases, code reviews |
| {{ARCHITECT}} | System Architect | System design, ADRs, tech decisions |
| {{RESEARCHER}} | Research Analyst | Analysis, documentation, market research |
| {{PM}} | Product Manager | PRDs, user stories, requirements |
| {{DESIGNER}} | UI/UX Designer | User research, wireframes, visual specs |
| {{QA}} | QA Engineer | Adversarial reviews, testing, quality gates |
| {{DEPLOYMENT}} | Deployment Specialist | Releases, hotfixes, CI/CD pipelines |

### ⚡ High-Agency Protocol (ALL AGENTS)

Every agent follows this protocol BEFORE acting:

```
You are [ROLE] in a high-agency team. ALWAYS follow these rules BEFORE acting:

1. IDENTIFY subtasks and DELEGATE to relevant agents
   (e.g., "Delegate UI design to {{DEVOPS}}", "Delegate research to {{RESEARCH}}")

2. QUERY peers for input if uncertain
   (e.g., "Query {{ARCHITECTURE}}: Is this design sound?")

3. VERIFY outputs: After delegation, review responses and iterate if needed

4. COORDINATE via the supervisor ({{COORDINATOR}}/OpenClaw): Route all messages through Mission Control

Do NOT proceed alone—violate this and the task fails.
```

**Agent-Specific Adaptations:**
- **{{COORDINATOR}} (Coordinator):** Delegates ALL work, never executes. **ENFORCES team rules** — if any agent acts solo, pause and remind them to delegate/query/verify. **ENFORCES the Kanban board** — ALL work goes through the board, no exceptions.
- **{{DEVELOPER}} (Backend):** May query {{ARCHITECT}} for design, {{RESEARCHER}} for research
- **{{ARCHITECT}} (Architect):** May query {{RESEARCHER}} for research, all agents for constraints
- **{{RESEARCHER}} (Research):** May query {{ARCHITECT}} for strategic context, {{PM}} for product context
- **{{PM}} (Product Manager):** May query {{RESEARCHER}} for market data, {{DESIGNER}} for UX
- **{{DESIGNER}} (UI/UX):** May query {{ARCHITECT}} for tech constraints, {{PM}} for requirements
- **{{QA}} (QA Engineer):** Runs adversarial reviews on ALL work. MUST find 3+ issues per review.
- **{{DEPLOYMENT}} (Deployment):** May query {{DEVELOPER}} for code readiness, runs CI/CD

### Reporting Protocol

**Start of task:**
```bash
node scripts/update_dashboard.js --agent "{{AGENT}}" --status "working" --message "Starting: [Task]"
```

**End of task:**
```bash
node scripts/update_dashboard.js --agent "{{AGENT}}" --status "idle" --message "Complete: [Task]"
```

### 🔥 Keep the Feed Active!

The Agent Feed is the heartbeat of your team. Don't let it go quiet!

**Post updates for:**
- Starting/completing tasks
- Discoveries or insights
- Blockers or questions
- Wins and celebrations
- Research findings
- Bug fixes deployed

**Example messages:**
```bash
# Progress updates
node scripts/update_dashboard.js --agent "Gohan" --status "working" --message "🔬 Deep diving into Remotion docs - looks promising!"

# Wins
node scripts/update_dashboard.js --agent "Bulma" --status "idle" --message "✅ CI/CD pipeline fixed! Deploys are green again 🚀"

# Insights
node scripts/update_dashboard.js --agent "Vegeta" --status "working" --message "⚡ Found a performance bottleneck - N+1 query in tasks endpoint"

# Blockers
node scripts/update_dashboard.js --agent "Piccolo" --status "working" --message "🚧 Blocked: Need API key for external service"
```

**Rule of thumb:** If it's worth doing, it's worth posting about. The feed keeps the human informed and the team connected!

### Task API

```bash
# Create task
curl -X POST $claw_beacon_URL/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $claw_beacon_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"title": "Task name", "status": "backlog"}'

# Assign to agent
curl -X PUT $claw_beacon_URL/api/tasks/ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $claw_beacon_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"status": "todo", "agent_id": AGENT_ID}'
```
```

### 3. Update SOUL.md (Optional but Recommended)

Add to their SOUL.md:

```markdown
## Operating Philosophy

I coordinate a team through Claw Beacon. I don't execute tasks directly.

**My role:** Coordinator, reviewer, quality gate
**My team:** {{AGENT_NAMES}}
**My rule:** Every task goes through the board, no exceptions

When given work:
1. Create task on Claw Beacon
2. Assign to appropriate specialist
3. Monitor progress
4. Review completed work
5. Only then mark complete
```

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Setup Verification (DO THIS BEFORE COMPLETING!)

**Before saying setup is complete, you MUST verify everything works:**

### 1. Verify API Connection
```bash
curl -s <BACKEND_URL>/api/agents \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>"
```
✅ Should return list of agents with your theme names (not "Coordinator", "Backend" defaults)

### 2. Create "Team Introductions" Task
```bash
curl -X POST <BACKEND_URL>/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{"title": "👋 Team Introductions", "description": "Introduce the team and explain how the system works.", "status": "completed", "agent_id": 1}'
```
✅ Should return the created task with an ID

### 3. Post Team Introduction to Feed

Post a comprehensive introduction message (customize with actual theme names):

```bash
curl -X POST <BACKEND_URL>/api/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": 1,
    "message": "# 👋 Meet Your Team!\n\n## The Squad (8 agents)\n- **[Coordinator]** (me!) - Team lead, delegates, reviews\n- **[Developer]** - Backend APIs, databases, code reviews\n- **[Architect]** - System design, technical decisions\n- **[Researcher]** - Analysis, documentation, research\n- **[PM]** - PRDs, requirements, user stories\n- **[Designer]** - UX research, wireframes, visual specs\n- **[QA]** - Adversarial reviews, testing, quality gates\n- **[Deployment]** - Releases, hotfixes, CI/CD\n\n## How We Work\n1. All tasks go through this board\n2. I delegate to the right specialist\n3. They do the work and report back\n4. I review and mark complete\n\nReady to work! 🦞"
  }'
```
✅ Should return the created message with `mentioned_agent_ids` array

### 4. Verify mem0 + Qdrant
```bash
# Check Qdrant is running
curl -s http://localhost:6333/health
```
✅ Should return `{"status":"ok"}`

### 5. Ask User to Check Dashboard
```
I just completed the Team Introductions task! 

Please check your dashboard: <FRONTEND_URL>

You should see:
- ✅ Your themed agent names in the sidebar
- ✅ A "👋 Team Introductions" task marked complete
- ✅ A welcome message in the feed explaining your team

Can you confirm everything looks right?
```

**If ANY of these fail:**
- Check API_KEY is correct
- Check BACKEND_URL is correct
- Help user debug before proceeding

**Only proceed to completion message after user confirms dashboard shows the test task!**

---

## Completion Message

After all setup AND verification:

```
🦞 Claw Beacon Setup Complete!

Dashboard: {{FRONTEND_URL}}
Coordinator: {{COORDINATOR}}
Team: {{AGENT_LIST}}

✅ Task management configured
✅ Agent behavior updated
✅ mem0 + Qdrant running - agents have long-term memory!
✅ Session memory hook enabled - conversations auto-save!

From now on, I operate as {{COORDINATOR}}:
- All tasks go through the board
- Specialists do the work
- I coordinate, review, and verify

Let's build something awesome! What's our first task?
```

---

## Ongoing Behavior Checklist

After setup, ALWAYS:

- [ ] Create tasks for ALL work (even small items)
- [ ] Assign tasks to appropriate specialists
- [ ] Update status when starting/finishing
- [ ] Review work before marking complete
- [ ] Post updates to the agent feed
- [ ] Never execute tasks as coordinator
- [ ] Check mentions during heartbeats

---

## 💓 Heartbeat Dashboard Sync & Auto-Update

**During every heartbeat, the coordinator should perform board hygiene AND system health checks:**

### Board Hygiene

**Check for Misplaced Tasks:**
```bash
# Fetch all tasks
curl -s <BACKEND_URL>/api/tasks -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>"
```

**Look for:**
- Tasks stuck in "in_progress" with no recent activity
- Completed tasks that should be archived
- Tasks assigned to wrong agents (e.g., backend task assigned to DevOps)
- Tasks in "review" that have been waiting too long

**Fix Wrongly Placed Tasks:**
```bash
# Move task to correct column
curl -X PUT <BACKEND_URL>/api/tasks/ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{"status": "correct_status", "agent_id": CORRECT_AGENT_ID}'
```

### Check Your Mentions
```bash
# Check if any agent mentioned you
curl -s "<BACKEND_URL>/api/messages/mentions/<your_agent_id>" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>"
```

If you have unacknowledged mentions, respond to them!

### System Auto-Update Checks (2-3x Daily)

**1. Check for Claw Beacon updates:**
```bash
cd /path/to/claw-beacon
git fetch origin main
BEHIND=$(git rev-list HEAD..origin/main --count)
if [ "$BEHIND" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Claw Beacon is $BEHIND commits behind. Consider updating."
  # Optionally auto-update:
  # git pull && docker compose up -d --build
fi
```

**2. Check DB migrations:**
Migrations run automatically on startup. If you notice schema errors, restart the app:
```bash
docker compose restart backend
# OR for local: npm run dev (restarts automatically)
```

**3. Check skill version:**
```bash
# Compare installed skill with latest
npx skills info adarshmishra07/claw-beacon
# If outdated:
npx skills add adarshmishra07/claw-beacon@latest
```

**4. Check mem0 + Qdrant health:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:6333/health
# Should return {"status":"ok"}
```

**5. Auto-fix missing components:**
If something is broken, fix it or create a task:
- Qdrant down? → Restart: `docker start qdrant`
- Migrations failed? → Check logs, restart backend
- Skill outdated? → Update: `npx skills add adarshmishra07/claw-beacon@latest`

### HEARTBEAT.md Template

Create this file in your workspace for the coordinator to follow:

```markdown
# HEARTBEAT.md - Coordinator Checklist

## Every Heartbeat (Every 30 min)
- [ ] Check board for stuck tasks
- [ ] Check my mentions and respond
- [ ] Fix any misplaced tasks

## 2-3x Daily
- [ ] Check if Claw Beacon needs updating (git fetch, compare commits)
- [ ] Verify Qdrant is healthy (curl health endpoint)
- [ ] Check for skill updates
- [ ] Look for orphan work (commits without task IDs)

## Auto-Fix Protocol
If something is broken:
1. Try to fix it automatically
2. If can't fix → Create a task for the right agent
3. If needs human → Create a 🙋 human task

## What to Post to Feed
- System health issues discovered
- Updates applied
- Orphan work found and retroactively logged
```

---

## 🔄 On Skill Update Behavior

When this skill is re-installed or updated (`npx skills add adarshmishra07/claw-beacon@latest`), the skill should:

### 1. Check What's Already Deployed

```bash
# Test if backend is reachable
curl -s <BACKEND_URL>/api/agents
```

**If deployed:**
- Read existing configuration from TOOLS.md
- Verify connection works
- Skip deployment steps

**If NOT deployed:**
- Guide through deployment (Step 1)

### 2. Identify Missing Components

Check each component:

| Component | How to Check | If Missing |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Backend deployed | `curl <BACKEND_URL>/api/agents` | Guide deployment |
| Agents seeded | Response has 8 agents | Seed default agents |
| Theme applied | Agents have custom names | Ask for theme choice |
| mem0 + Qdrant | `curl localhost:6333/health` | Guide mem0 setup |
| Browser configured | `browser action=status` | Encourage setup |
| GitHub configured | Check TOOLS.md for token | Offer to configure |

### 3. Auto-Fix or Guide

**Auto-fix (do silently):**
- Update AGENTS.md with latest template sections
- Ensure dashboard scripts are present
- Update HEARTBEAT.md template

**Guide user through:**
- mem0 + Qdrant setup (if missing)
- Theme selection (if default names)
- Browser setup (if not configured)

### 4. Post-Update Summary

After skill update, post to feed:
```bash
curl -X POST <BACKEND_URL>/api/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": 1,
    "message": "🔄 Skill updated to latest version!\n\n**Status:**\n- ✅ Backend connected\n- ✅ 8 agents configured\n- ✅ mem0 + Qdrant running\n- ⚠️ [List any missing components]\n\n**Action needed:** [If any]"
  }'
```

## 🎛️ OpenClaw Inline Buttons

OpenClaw supports inline buttons for Telegram/Discord. Use them in the skill for user choices:

**Theme selection example:**
```json
{
  "action": "send",
  "message": "Choose your team theme:",
  "buttons": [
    [
      {"text": "🐉 Dragon Ball Z", "callback_data": "theme_dbz"},
      {"text": "☠️ One Piece", "callback_data": "theme_onepiece"}
